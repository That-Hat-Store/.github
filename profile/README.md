# That Hat Store—where headwear reigns supreme!
That Hat Store is a store with a ever changing hat collection. From January to December, we have you covered—literally!

# Why is this on github? 
Because we don't have the money to pay a company (Shopify, GoDaddy, WooCommerce, Wordpress) to build and host our website. We don't make much.



# If you don't make much money, why are you selling your hats at 20$-30$? 
Because it takes a lot of money to manufacture a hat and make a good profit in return. We make 3$-12$ per hat. 


## Copyright policy
We ask that you do not copy any designs (Logo, Hat mockups, Hat design, Pictures etc). We work hard on making these things. We also ask that you do not use our mailing form, because if you do, you will mess sonthing up, and probably make our customer support go on strike.
