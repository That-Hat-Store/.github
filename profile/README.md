# That Hat Store—where headwear reigns supreme!
That Hat Store is a store with a ever changing hat collection. From January to December, we have you covered—literally!

# Why is this on github? 
Because we don't have the money to pay a company (Shopify, GoDaddy, WooCommerce, Wordpress) to build and host our website. We don't make much.

# If you don't make much money, why are you selling your hats at 20$-30$? 
Because it takes a lot of money to manufacture a hat and make a good profit in return. We make 3$-12$ per hat.
